# Unity-Patch-Fixes-Combiner
Combines a number of unity version patch fixes notes into one html page with categories

You need to have Python installed and the beautifulsoup4 installed
"pip install requests beautifulsoup4"

# Modify the script here to the version range you want to view with these variables
```
  unity_version = "2023.1" Change this variable as needed

  start_version = "10" Change these variables as needed
  end_version = "15" Change these variables as needed
```
Run it and it should open a neat html page displaying changes from 2023.1.10 to 2023.1.15 from your computer!
This could take a couple of seconds to complete, if you run it from a python IDE you should get print info about the progress as well.

Cheers
