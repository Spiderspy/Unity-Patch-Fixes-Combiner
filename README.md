# Unity-Patch-Fixes-Combiner
Combines a number of unity version patch fixes notes into one html page with categories

You need to have Python installed and the beautifulsoup4 installed
"pip install requests beautifulsoup4"

Modify the script here to the version range you want to view with these variables

------
# Define the Unity version
unity_version = "2023.1"  # Change this variable as needed

# Define the starting and ending patch versions
start_version = "10"  # Change these variables as needed
end_version = "15"    # Change these variables as needed
------

Then run it and it should open a neat html page from your computer!

Cheers
