# Unity-Patch-Fixes-Combiner
Combines a number of unity version patch fixes notes into one html page with categories

You need to have Python installed and the beautifulsoup4 installed
"pip install requests beautifulsoup4"

Modify the script here to the version range you want to view with these variables

------
unity_version = "2023.1"  # Change this variable as needed
start_version = "10"  # Change these variables as needed
end_version = "15"    # Change these variables as needed
------

Run it and it should open a neat html page displaying changes from 2023.1.10 to 2023.1.15 from your computer!

Cheers
